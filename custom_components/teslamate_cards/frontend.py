"""Serve the card bundle and register it as a Lovelace resource.

Adapted from ``ha-rss-newsreader-card``, including the HA 2026.7
``mode`` -> ``resource_mode`` rename fallback.

The ``?v=`` on the resource URL is the only cache-buster. The bundle is served
with a 31-day ``max-age``, so a browser that already has it will not ask again
until that URL changes -- there is no revalidation to fall back on.

The key is ``<manifest version>.<content hash>``, and the hash half is not
belt-and-braces. The version alone is only a correct cache key for *released*
installs: deploy straight from a branch, or hand-copy the package, and the
bundle changes while release-please has not yet bumped the manifest, so the URL
stays byte-identical and every browser keeps running the previous module. That
is a silent failure -- the server is serving the new bundle the whole time.

Measured, deploying the Statistics card that way: the new tab rendered Home
Assistant's generic "Configuration error" card, because the element simply was
not defined in the module the browser still held, while ``curl`` on the same URL
returned a bundle that defined it.

Hashing the bytes actually served makes the URL stale only when the bundle is
unchanged, which is exactly when a stale cache is the right answer. It also
makes the console banner a real build id, since that reads its version back off
this URL.
